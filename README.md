# BaseBot_Obstacke_Course
# Course Description and Obstacle Details:
# Me, Miles, and Luka made our course with 3x4 tiles.  While researching I found out each tile is about 1 by 1 feet, so the whole mat we created is about 12 feet squared.  As seen in the images and design files, you can see that we have the minimum of 5 obstacles for the robot to get around. 1 & 2, 3, 4 & 5.  
# We hot glued the obstacles to the mat and in the process I (Ashton) burned my finger because hot glue got on it.  We meant to use more obstacles but some of them were either to slim for the robot to drive over, or just to steep to go up without it getting stuck.  

# How the BaseBot interacts with each obstacle
# To be completely honest, when we were coding and building the robot, we thought about adding sensors, but for now we thought it might make the robot too cautious to drive over some of the obstacles, so we just stuck to left motor 6 and right motor 10.  So instead of the BaseBot seeing and interacting, we coded the robot to take down and drive over the obstacles easily.  by using some math, like figuring out the circumference of the wheel, using pi, and the length of the tile, we found out each tile requires about 424 degrees of wheel rotation to clear each tile.  We havent tested it yet so we arent completely sure if the ramps will make us need more or less degrees but according to our calculations, as long as the wheel doesnt slip it should be 424 degrees still for each tile.

# How to run our python script

# To run our python script, you connect the bot to the device, download the code file to the robot, run the code on the VEX Brain, and put the rear 2 wheels on the very back of the first starting tile.  As soon as you do that, you should be able to press drive and the robot will complete the course.  Once again we havent used trial and error on the course so we are not 100% sure this code even perfectly works but I would give it a 98% chance it does work.  

# What went well and what challenges we faced

# There were so many challenges in this, the main one was figuring out how to code with vex and especially python, as both are very new to me.  Another thing that made me tired was calculating how many times the wheels have to spin to go up a tile, and lastly another challenge was finding out how to get the variables working as I always used to code blocks.  Apart from that, everything went well, from gluing the tiles to coding the bot and designing the course, and many other things went quite well.
